This is inverse cropper for yolo v3 form tagged images set.
This is made for cropping images using tagged txt files and jpg files.

You need to install opencv-python.
And make dir "input" and "output" in same folder.

then you just excute the crop_yolo.py
[output file name] : classnum_imagename.jpg

warnning :

Thanks.
